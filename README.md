**The doubly connected edge list (DCEL)**, also known as half-edge data structure, is a data structure to represent an embedding of a planar graph in the plane, and polytopes in 3D.
This data structure provides efficient manipulation of the topological information associated with the objects in question (vertices, edges, faces).
It is used in many algorithms of computational geometry to handle polygonal subdivisions of the plane, commonly called planar straight-line graphs (PSLG).
For example, a Voronoi diagram is commonly represented by a DCEL inside a bounding box.

## INPUT FORMAT: is that of Adjacency list

1st line specifies number of vertices, v
2nd line number of edges, e
Subsequent 'v' lines specifies vertices as space seprated cordinate points.
Subsequent 'e' lines specifies edges as space seprated verice name which they are connecting.
